# HCI-FP-Student-Showcase 
 
A new Flutter project aiming to solve issues related to the online version of CCSC MW.

## Build Week #1 Memo 
  This project was a lot of fun to make and I learned a lot about flutter in the process which is beneficial. I did notice some potential issues with my prototype after completing the development. These problems were mostly due to error handling which is something I did not realize would be such a big issue during my analysis. Another problem I ran into was getting the ListView widget to work properly, I sourced out the flutter widget documentation and it explained it a bit. The problem was it was not rendering because it was not included inside of an expanded widget. I feel like this experience helped me learn more about how Flutter displays content relatively. There are some things I want to improve in the next iteration such as adding more color, including an input for the judge to leave a note for the student, and ordering the students by ranking.
