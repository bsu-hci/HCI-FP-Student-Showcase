# HCI-FP-Student-Showcase 
 
A new Flutter project aiming to solve issues related to the online version of CCSC.

Built using Flutter and Dart.

## Build Week #2 Memo 
  Build week # 2 proved to be a lot easier than #1 and I think that is because I had the idea of what I wanted the app to be and just needed to improve on what I had created last week for the last build week. I ended up adding rationales to each rating that is provided for the judge to give to a studentâ€™s submission. I ended up sticking with my 1-5 rating system, but gave the values meaning. This should help the judges figure out what their ratings mean and improve the accuracy of the ratings. I added a section for the judge to leave a note for the student so that they can see what the judge personally thought of their submission. I wanted to add some color to my page and decided to do this with the notes text box. I added a small border which I needed to consult flutters widget documentation about text fields to get working properly. Overall, there were not many errors that I realized in this build week and I believe that my application is ready for testing.
